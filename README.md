# codeChallenge

Coding_challenge.py contains a function called getLowTempSprd_Day() that reads the w_data (5).dat file as input. It returns the day with the smallest temperature spread.  Coding_challenge.py also contains another function named getMinGoalDif_Team() that reads the soccer.dat file as input and returns the team with the smallest difference in 'for'
and 'against' goals.

The second function is influenced by writing the first function. Both functions iterate a file while storing the most current smallest difference value found.
